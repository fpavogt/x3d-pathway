README: x3d_to_html
-------------------

The HTML files

'green_dice.html', 'red_dice.html', 'HCG91.html'

located in their respective folders illustrate how the X3DOM syntax can be used to include interactive 3-D models in HTML documents via X3D files. 

The 'green_dice.html' document contains the minimal HTML code required for the creation of an interactive figure. The 'red_dice.html' explores some of the limitations currently associated with the X3D exporter inside Mayavi, and describes how to correct these manually. The 'red_dice.html' also describes the creation of action buttons to set pre-defined views and toggle specific datasets on & off, and display a colorbar.

The 'HCG91.html' exploits the tools described in 'red_dice.html' to create the full interactive HTML 3-D model of the HI gas content of the compact group of galaxies HCG 91. 

These HTML files can be opened with most mainstream web browsers, and have been tested successfully with Firefox, Safari and Chrome. They can be edited using any text editor.
