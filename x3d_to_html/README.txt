README: x3d_to_html
-------------------

The HTML files

'green_dice.html', 'red_dice.html', 'HCG91.html' and ‘1E0102.html’

located in their respective folders illustrate how the X3DOM syntax can be used to include interactive 3-D models in HTML documents via X3D files. 

The 'green_dice.html' document contains the minimal HTML code required for the creation of an interactive figure. The 'red_dice.html' explores some of the limitations currently associated with the X3D exporter inside Mayavi, and describes how to correct these manually. The 'red_dice.html' also describes the creation of action buttons to set pre-defined views and toggle specific datasets on & off, and display a colorbar.

The 'HCG91.html' model exploits the tools described in 'red_dice.html' to create the full interactive HTML 3-D model of the HI gas content of the compact group of galaxies HCG 91. 

The ‘1E0102.html’ model uses clip planes to allow readers to the measurements from the interactive model (distances and angles).

These HTML files can be opened with most mainstream web browsers, and have been tested successfully with Firefox, Safari and Chrome. They can be edited using any text editor.

### ATTENTION CHROME USERS ###

When loading an interactive HTML model locally (i.e. from a file downloaded on a local computer), Chrome will fail to display it properly. This is not an X3D bug - but rather a “feature” of Chrome, which does not load local files by default. The web is fully of lengthy discussions about it. 

One work-around is to launch Chrome from a terminal using the following command (under Mac OS X):

open /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app —args --allow-file-access-from-files
