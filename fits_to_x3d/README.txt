README: fits_to_x3d
-------------------

The Python scripts

'green_dice.py', 'red_dice.py', 'HCG91.py'

located in their respective folders illustrate how the Mayavi Python package can be used to create interactive 3-D diagrams, and export them to X3D files. 

Each script is commented throughout for clarity. To run them, launch a Python shell and type (e.g. for the green dice example):

run green_dice.py

You will need an up-to-date Python installation. The minimal set of packages required are:

- Mayavi from Enthought (tested with v4.4.0)
- astropy (tested with v1.0.1)
- numpy (tested with v1.8.1)
