From the article abstract: "In this article, we introduce the concept of the “X3D pathway” as a mean of simplifying the process of and easing the access to data visualization via three-dimensional (3-D) diagrams. The X3D pathway exploits the facts that 1) the X3D 3-D file format lies at the center of a product tree that includes interactive HTML documents, 3-D printing, and high-end animations, and 2) all high-impact factors & peer-reviewed journals in Astrophysics are now published (some exclusively) online. We argue that the X3D format is an ideal vector for sharing and visualizing multi-dimensional datasets, as it provides direct access to a range of different (and complementary) data visualization techniques, is fully-open source, and is a well defined ISO standard. Unlike other earlier propositions to visualize and publish multi-dimensional datasets via 3-D diagrams, the concept of the X3D pathway is not tied to specific software (prone to rapid and unexpected evolution), but instead compatible with a range of open-source & mainstream software already in use by our community. As of 2015, the interactive HTML branch of the X3D pathway is also actively supported by leading peer-reviewed journals in the field of Astrophysics. Beside a detailed description of the X3D pathway, this article provides interested readers with a complete set of real astrophysical examples - including all scripts, raw data and visualization products - designed to act as a stepping stone towards the implementation of the X3D pathway for any other dataset."
